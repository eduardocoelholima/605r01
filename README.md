# CSCI-605 Recitation - week 1 

Welcome to 605!

Here you will find a couple of code snippets as well
as some notes that are somehow related to the first
homework of RIT course CSCI605. 

Follow this order:
- Number.java
- Factorial.java
- Fibonacci.java
- Fibonacci.md
- NumberProperties.java

In each of these files, you will find a header with a
few learning objectives.

Please let me know if you have any questions. You can
always use MyCourses discussion forum (good idea) or
email me or Professor Bischof. I will reply the questions
either to the discussion forum or will email everyone so
every student can benefit from the answers provided.


Cheers,
